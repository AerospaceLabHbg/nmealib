 * Shows data about the satellites that the unit might be able to find based on
 * its viewing mask and almanac data. It also shows current ability to track
 * this data. Note that one GPGSV sentence only can provide data for up to 4
 * satellites and thus there may need to be 3 sentences for the full
 * information. It is reasonable for the GPGSV sentence to contain more satellites
 * than GPGGA might indicate since GPGSV may include satellites that are not used as
 * part of the solution. It is not a requirement that the GPGSV sentences all
 * appear in sequence. To avoid overloading the data bandwidth some receivers
 * may place the various sentences in totally different samples since each
 * sentence identifies which one it is.
 *
 * The field called SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) in the NMEA standard is often
 * referred to as signal strength. SNR is an indirect but more useful value than
 * raw signal strength. It can range from 0 to 99 and has units of dB according
 * to the NMEA standard, but the various manufacturers send different ranges of
 * numbers with different starting numbers so the values themselves cannot
 * necessarily be used to evaluate different units. The range of working values
 * in a given gps will usually show a difference of about 25 to 35 between the
 * lowest and highest values, however 0 is a special case and may be shown on
 * satellites that are in view but not being tracked.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $GPGSV,2,1,08,01,40,083,46,02,17,308,41,12,07,344,39,14,22,228,45*75
